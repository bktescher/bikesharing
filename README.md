## Summary
Trends established by the data is that males use the service more often and for longer durations than females.  Usage spikes in the mornings and at rush hour in the evenings.  And subscribers utilize the services much more frequently than non-subscribed customers.  Further analysis should be conducted to find the distances traveled and how seasonal weather affects utilization.  Thank you.
